I usually use an instant pot and put, together:
- half a cup of rice
- half a cup of split moong bean
- about a cup of water
Then I pressure cook it for around 15 minutes.

split moong bean looks like this https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Moong-Dal-Pesticides-Adulteration/dp/B00UPMJDWY/ref=s[â€¦]02073&s=grocery&sprefix=moong+dal+split%2Cgrocery%2C46&sr=1-6

- Then I put oil (or ghee) in a skillet on the stove
- then put a few other things in the skillet to roast (cut ginger pieces, black peppercorns, split cashews, cumin seeds)
- then I put the cooked rice + split moong bean in the skillet, mix it with turmeric powder + salt
- then the pongal is ready!
